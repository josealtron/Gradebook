This project is called "Gradebook for Students".

Features:
-Keeps track of student assignment grades that the user enters

-Organizes grades into categories, which can then compute averages for each category

-Categories can be weighted, as in a normal class, which is used to compute a true
final class average that the student can see

-Project future averages based on future assignment grades

-Can be customized to support different grading/scoring scales

This project was started in July 2019, prior to me beginning my CS degree at Georgia
State University in Fall 2019.
